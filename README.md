#### Description:

Command-line REPL javascript console. [`web3.js`](https://github.com/ethereum/web3.js/) provides access to an Ethereum blockchain. Compiled contracts are represented as objects. Each deployed contract (with available [`dapp-deploy`](https://github.com/launchpadinc/dapp-deploy) metadata) is associated with its on-chain address.

#### Installation:

```bash
npm install -g @launchpadinc/dapp-console
```

*aside:*
* Before installation, you first might want to check whether your `$PATH` contains any conflicting symbolic links: `which dapp-console`
* At present, the [`dapphub/dapp`](https://github.com/dapphub/dapp) toolchain doesn't include a `console` library; But that may change in the future.

#### Simple Example:

```bash
lxterminal -e testrpc

mkdir ~/my_dapp
cd ~/my_dapp

dapp init
dapp deploy
dapp console

# > typeof web3
# 'object'

# > web3.eth.accounts

#### Options:

$ dapp-console --help

Command-line REPL javascript console.
'Web3.js' provides access to an Ethereum blockchain.
Compiled contracts are represented as objects.
Each deployed contract (with available 'dapp-deploy' metadata)
is associated with its on-chain address.

Usage: dapp-console [options]


Options:
 -h, --host                 Ethereum JSON-RPC server hostname  [string] [default: "localhost"]
 -p, --port                 Ethereum JSON-RPC server port number  [number] [default: 8545]
 --tls, --https, --ssl      Require TLS handshake (https:) to connect to Ethereum JSON-RPC server  [boolean] [default: false]
 -d, --contracts_directory  Path to directory containing all contract artifacts: (.abi, .deployed)
                            note: The default path assumes that the current directory is the root of a compiled "dapp" project.  [string] [default: "./out"]
 -i, --input_file           Path to javascript file to execute, then quit.  [string]
 -e, --execute              Inline javascript to execute, then quit  [string]
 --help                     Show help  [boolean]

Examples:
 dapp-console                                                                  connect to: "http://localhost:8545"
 dapp-console -h "mainnet.infura.io" -p 443 --ssl                              connect to: "https://mainnet.infura.io:443"
 dapp-console -d "/path/to/compiled/contracts"                                 load contracts into REPL console
 dapp-console -i "/path/to/script.js"                                          execute a script file
 dapp-console -e 'console.log("unlocked accounts:", "\n", web3.eth.accounts)'  execute an inline script

#### Notes:

* This tool is standalone
* It is intended to be used in combination with [`dapp-deploy`](https://github.com/launchpadinc/dapp-deploy)
* It is intended to complement the [`dapphub/dapp`](https://github.com/launchpadinc/dapp) toolchain
* When `dapp` is installed, this tool can be invoked by the command: `dapp console [options]`
* When used standalone, it can be invoked by the command: `dapp-console [options]`

#### Methodology:

* initialize web3
* find all .abi and .deployed files in "contracts directory"
* for each .abi:
  * create a javascript object to represent the contract
    * name of object = filename (without extension)
    * object = web3.eth.contract(abi)
  * if a corresponding .deployed file exists,<br>
    and 1+ addresses are mapped to the network ID of the current blockchain:
    * associate the object to the more recent deployment address
      * object = object.at(address)
* if `-e` is used to execute an inline script,<br>
  or `-i` is used to execute a script from an input file:
  * create a sandboxed execution environment
  * initialize its context to contain all of the contract objects
  * mixin a few additionally useful variables
  * run the script
  * if the return value is a `Promise`: wait until it resolves
  * exit
* otherwise:
  * begin the REPL

#### Additional Script Execution Context Variables:

* always available:
  * `toAscii(hex)`
    * trims trailing `\u0000` from `web3.toAscii(hex)`
      * When a "bytes32" is converted to a 32 character ascii string with `web3.toAscii(hex)`,
        if the string contains fewer than 32 characters,
        then the length of the string remains 32 bytes and the unused characters are filled with: "\u0000"
      * I noticed than when a script outputs several of these strings (ex: in `console.log()` statements),
        and the output is directed to a log file,
        only the first ("bytes32" converted) string appears in the file.
      * I believe this is the result of these "\u0000" characters being recognized by the file system
        as indicating an EOF (end-of-file) marker.
      * The purpose of this wrapper function is to sanitize the output of `web3.toAscii(hex)`
        so strings are safe to write to the file system.
* only available when executing `--input_file`
  * `__cwd`
    * current working directory
  * `__realpath`
    * the absolute path to the javascript file that is being evaluated
  * `__dirname`
    * the absolute path to the directory of the javascript file that is being evaluated
  * `__filename`
    * the filename of the javascript file that is being evaluated
